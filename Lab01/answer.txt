All printed doubles are formatted to 3 decimals 

Ex 2.2.5:
Input: a = 5, b = 14.67
=> sum = 19.67, difference = -11.67, product = 73.35, quotient = 0.341
Input: a = -12.345, b = 7
=> sum = -5.345, difference = -19.345, product = 86.415, quotient = 1.764
(idk how to deal with floating point clownery sorry)

Ex 2.2.6:
1) linear equation: ax + b = 0
Input: a = 3, b = 2 => x = -0.667
Input: a = 0, b = 15 => no solution
2) system of linear equations: a1x + b1y = c1; a2x + b2y = c2
Input: a1 = 4, b1 = 5, c1 = 8; a2 = 2, b2 = 5, c2 = 7 => x = 0.500, y = 1.200
Input: a1 = 2, b1 = 3, c1 = 4; a2 = 4, b2 = 6, c2 = 8 => inf solutions
3) quadratic equation: ax^2 + bx + c = 0
Input: a = 8, b = 4, c = 3 => no solution
Input: a = 45, b = 50, c = 8 => x1 = -0.194, x2 = -0.917

Ex 6.1:
Question 1: If the user chooses "cancel", the program outputs: "You've chosen: No"
Question 2: To modify the options the user has, we can use an overloaded version of showConfirmDialog, which takes more parameters.
showConfirmDialog can take these parameters, in this order:
- parentComponent: we don't care about this one (heck i dont even understand what it is lol)
- message: (String) what message to be displayed in the dialog box
- title: (String) what the dialog box's title should be. This isn't relevant to our case, but it's good to know regardless.
- optionType: the options we can let the user choose from. in JOptionPane, the following are possible to be optionType:
	+ JOptionPane.YES_NO_OPTION
	+ JOptionPane.YES_NO_CANCEL_OPTION
	+ JOptionPane.OK_CANCEL_OPTION
	+ JOptionPane.DEFAULT_OPTION: gives a single "Ok" option to the user
	these let us customize what options the users have
